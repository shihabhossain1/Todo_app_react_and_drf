## 🚀 Getting Started

### Backend (Django REST Framework)

#### 📦 Setup

1. **Navigate to the Django project folder:**
   ```bash
   cd drf_todo
````

2. **Create and activate virtual environment (if not already):**

   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate   # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Run migrations:**

   ```bash
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

5. **Start the backend server:**

   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

The API will now be available at: `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`

### Frontend (React)

#### 📦 Setup

1. **Navigate to the React app folder:**

   ```bash
   cd react/todo-app
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the frontend server:**

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

The React app will now be available at: `http://localhost:3000/`

## ⚙️ API and Frontend Connection

Make sure your frontend is making requests to the correct Django API URL (`http://127.0.0.1:8000/`). You can configure this in your React app's environment variables or API config file.
